# Assumptions and Constraints

1. I assume that the incoming webhook data is not overly complex and is in JSON format.
2. The internal services have a fixed 30% error rate and a 30% probability of delays.
3. Given the 6-hour timeframe, it’s unlikely I’ll integrate a major database or queue system (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ). However, in practice, a message queue would be the more robust solution.
4. Scalability: If the load could exceed 1000 requests/second, horizontal scaling (Kubernetes, load balancer, etc.) might come into play. For the current context, a simpler solution is sufficient.
5. The load pattern of webhooks can depend on many factors, but generally it’s a continuous, steady load. I plan to implement a LOAD test for the API, and if time permits, also a SPIKE test (since webhooks often have a retry mechanism if they don’t receive a successful response; a sudden network issue or 500 error can lead to a large number of retries arriving at once), as well as a SOAK test and finally a STRESS test at 2×–3× scale.
6. I also assume I don’t need to implement any special security measures (like DOS protection or injection prevention).
7. I assume the incoming data is valid and I don’t need to handle its contents. If time allows, I’ll implement validation for incoming data.

# Possible Challenges

1. **Network instability:** The mock services deliberately return uncertain responses. The webhook service must handle this so it doesn’t break entirely (for example, by using a retry logic).
2. **High load:** 1000 requests per second is not negligible. We need to ensure the application processes requests asynchronously and doesn’t block.
3. **Timing and delays:** The random 30-second delay can cause disruptions. The Node.js event loop must not be blocked (so we should avoid synchronous sleeps and instead use asynchronous timeouts).
